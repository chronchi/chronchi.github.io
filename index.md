I am currently a Master student in the [Mathematics Department](https://icmc.usp.br/en/admission/graduate/mathematics)
at [Universidade de São Paulo](http://www5.usp.br/english/?lang=en)
in São Carlos, studying under the supervision of [Dr. Marcio Gameiro](http://www.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/gameiro/).

My research interests are in topological data analysis, machine learning and ways
to combine both areas as well as real world applications.
