I am currently an intern at [Brisken's lab](https://brisken-lab.epfl.ch) @EPFL working with RNA-seq and data analysis.
I hold a master degree in Mathematics from [Universidade de São Paulo](http://www5.usp.br/english/?lang=en) under the
supervision of [Prof. Dr. Marcio Gameiro](http://www.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/gameiro/) with a 6 months resarch exchange programm
at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) under supervision of 
[Prof. Dr. Konstantin Mischaikow](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~mischaik/)

My research interests are in computational biology, topological data analysis, machine learning.

I hold a degree in Mathematics obtained at Universidade Federal do Paraná, in Curitiba - Brazil.
During my undergraduate studies I was an exchange student at Bonn University for
one year.
